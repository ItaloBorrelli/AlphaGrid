# The step above creates a new Neon branch.
# You may want to do something with the new branch, such as run migrations, run tests
# on it, or send the connection details to a hosting platform environment.
# The branch DATABASE_URL is available to you via:
# "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}".
# It's important you don't log the DATABASE_URL as output as it contains a username and
# password for your database.
# For example, you can uncomment the lines below to run a database migration command:
#      - name: Run Migrations
#        run: npm run db:migrate
#        env:
#          # to use pooled connection
#          DATABASE_URL: "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url_with_pooler }}"
#          # OR to use unpooled connection
#          # DATABASE_URL: "${{ steps.create_neon_branch.outputs.db_url }}"
