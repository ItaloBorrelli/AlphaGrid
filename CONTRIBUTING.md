# Contributing to AlphaGrid

Welcome and thank you for considering contributing to AlphaGrid! The following are guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Branch Naming Conventions

We use specific naming conventions for our branches to keep our repository organized and to understand the purpose of each branch at a glance:

    Feature Branches: feature/<issue-number>-description
        For new features and enhancements.
        Example: feature/42-add-user-authentication

    Bugfix Branches: bugfix/<issue-number>-description
        For bug fixes.
        Example: bugfix/43-fix-login-error

    Hotfix Branches: hotfix/<issue-number>-description
        For critical fixes that need to be deployed immediately.
        Example: hotfix/44-fix-security-vulnerability

Include a brief description after the issue number, separated by hyphens, for more clarity.

## Commit Message Guidelines

To maintain a clear and consistent history, we follow these commit message guidelines:

    Format: [#<issue-number>] <Commit Message>
    Start the commit message with an issue number enclosed in square brackets.
    Write a concise summary in the imperative mood, as if completing the sentence "If applied, this commit will..."
    Follow the best practices outlined in this guide.

Example Commit Message

```bash
git commit -m "[#42] Add user authentication logic" -m "Implemented a basic authentication system including login and logout functionality. Added necessary unit tests."
```
